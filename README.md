# bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis

The following analysis is done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. This is done by thorough analysis of New York City bikesharing data. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders has requested to see a bike trip analysis. 

## Results

After a deep and thorough analysis of the New York City bikesharing data, multiple obsvervations were taken into account. 

### August Peak Hours

It was easy to observe that most bikeriders preferred the late hours of the day preferrably between 5pm and 7pm as shown below:

### Customers v. Subscribers

The analysis showed that subscribers really enjoyed their bikeriding activities as they took the majority of the bikeriders as compared to non-subscribers depicted in the image below:

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

A more informative way of showing peak hours by weekday per hour is shown in the image below which also shows that bikeriding is really busy during most hours on Saturday:

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

This part of the analysis showed that female bikeriding activities were fairly the same throught the time of the day and each other day of the week as compared to the male bikeriders who were fairly active as shown below:

### Checkout Times for Users

The analysis showed that most bikeriders checked out in 5 to 6 minutes which can be shown by highlighting the peak of the line graph.

### Checkout Times by Gender

It is easily noted that checkout times by gender go hand in hand with the general line graph that proves even further that male participation is higher as it follows the male particiaption trend as shown below:

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

Another way of showing how male bikeriding participation massively outdid the female participation on every other day of the week is depicted below in which a deep color means a high participation whereas a light color shows minimal participation:

## Summary

Despite the above analysis, 2 more ways are seen to be crucial in presenting the right pitch to investors. That is: 

 * Comparing number of trips per month to see how a year of business would go and determine whether there is a particular time when business is not thriving as usual and ways to combat such as shown by the total of August below: 

    <img width="1512" alt="Number of Trips" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101376325/176442930-ef75d80b-b5ae-48e3-ba8d-69457135d265.png">

* Encouraging female participation since their number was twice less as much as male participation as illustrated below:

In conclusion, the key hurdle will be how to encourage female bikeriding participation as this will make the business thrive even more.
